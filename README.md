- Stock Availability

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- MongoDB Community Edition (local installation or Atlas account)
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh) or MongoDB Compass

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd mongodb-data-layer-fundamentals-and-advanced-techniques-Haftom2323
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start MongoDB service (if running locally)

### Populating the Database

Run the following command to populate your MongoDB database:

```bash
node insert_books.js
```

This will:
- Connect to your local MongoDB instance
- Create a database named `plp_bookstore`
- Create a collection named `books`
- Insert 22 book documents with diverse attributes

## üß™ Running Queries

To execute the example queries demonstrating MongoDB operations:

```bash
node queries.js
```

This script demonstrates:
- Basic CRUD operations
- Advanced queries with filtering and projection
- Aggregation pipelines
- Indexing and performance analysis

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `insert_books.js`: Script to populate the database with book data
- `queries.js`: Contains example MongoDB queries and operations
- `Week1-Assignment.md`: Original assignment instructions
- `collection.png`: Screenshot of the MongoDB collection

## üìö Learning Resources

- [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)
- [MongoDB Node.js Driver](https://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/)
- [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/aggregation/)

## üìù Notes

- The database connection is configured for local MongoDB by default
- Update the connection string in `insert_books.js` and `queries.js` if using MongoDB Atlas
- The `queries.js` file includes detailed comments explaining each operation
